    <p class="chatAppDescription">
        I created this web-based chat app during the summer of 2022. The website uses
        rooms which enable sending messages to a closed group. The website first requires
        a name, then the room to join and then the user can begin typing and sending messages to
        everyone in that room. In order to create the frontend where the users send and
        receive messages I used react.js. In order to emit messages to others in the room
        I used socket.io and express servers. The front end is hosted on netlify and the back end 
        is hosted on heroku This project taught me a lot about how to use react.js, socket.io and node.js.
