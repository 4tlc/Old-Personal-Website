    <p class="aboutMe"> Hi, I'm Tim.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am an aspiring computer scientist at Case Western Reserve University, cereal
        enthusiast, retired tennis player, proud godfather to a rescue chihuahua, owner of two basil
        plants, and an avid explorer.
        <br>
        <br>
        With a creative approach and analytical thinking, coding 
        enables me to create things such as this website (source code
        is on my github). I know there are many fields of compupter science 
        and while I don't know my specific interests yet, I can't wait to 
        try them all and learn as mush as possible. Stay tuned as I learn 
        more and  create new projects in my free time.
