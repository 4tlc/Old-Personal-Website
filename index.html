    <p class="aboutMe"> 
        Hi, I'm Tim.
        <br>
        <br>I'm a sophomore at Case Western Reserve University and an avid explorer 
        of both coding and nature (proof to the right).
        <br>
        <br>
        Coding allows me to design and create things with both a creative and analytical mindset. 
        Take, for example, this website (check out the source code on my GitHub). 
        <br>
        <br>
        Thus, I greatly enjoy creating new projects in my free time. Apart from this website, I have created two games, 
        an instant messaging website, and am currently working on an infinite runner using Unity. 
        These are all visible in the projects section of my website. 
        <br>
        <br>I will continue to update this website with new projects, so stay tuned!
